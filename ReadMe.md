EasyReads is an interactive software that is filled with literary works with the aim to facilitate the spread of ideas. These works include a catalog of over 70,000 books and class notes for numerous courses. Upon selected a book to read the user is given the option to Annotate that specific book. This way the user can spread their thoughts and analyses of a specific part of the book. Similarily, the user will also be able to see all other annotations made by other users at the bottom of the page, allowing them to gain an insight on other peoples analyses. 

In addition to this, once the user navigates to the class notes page, they are met with the option to choose any course from our numerous catalog. From there, they can either choose to read a specific note or they can choose to add their own.
